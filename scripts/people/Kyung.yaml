                    * now I thought we were doing the assignment for some other reading, because in the syllabus the assignment was
                    listed before the reading assignment, LitReview1: What is Open Source? by Steve Weber,
                    so I thought they were not related. I have read the chapter 3. Now I know about the assignment exactly,
                    I will redo it related to LitReview1: What is Open Source? by Steve Weber.
